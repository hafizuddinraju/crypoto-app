It is almost impossible to get lost as everything is just by the road and the locals are all very helpful.

        <p className="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-bold py-3">2. Bike Rentals:</p>
        <p className="text-justify">The easiest local transport in Havelock Island is by renting a scooter. You can hire them on a daily basis at approximately INR 500 per day. Fuel Stations shut by 5 pm, please make sure you have enough fuel. Avoid during monsoons as roads can get slippery.</p>
        <p className="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-bold py-3">3. Auto Rickshaws:</p>
        <p className="text-justify">Auto-rickshaws are also available and cost around INR 50 to 200 for short rides & 700-1000 for a trip to Radhanagar Beach.</p>
